Renewable Energy Project
Description
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of different renewable energy sources, 
including solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, and to investigate their potential for large-scale implementation.
The project also includes a cost-benefit analysis and a feasibility study for each energy source, as well as a comparison of the environmental 
impact of renewable energy and fossil fuels.





Requirement:


This appears to be an HTML template for a webpage that displays a map of renewable energy sources in the United States.
It uses the Leaflet JavaScript library to create the map and includes a style sheet that sets the font, colors, and layout of the page.

The page contains a header with a title and a subtitle, a div element that will hold the map, and a footer with some explanatory text. 
The JavaScript code loads the data for the power plants and sets the properties of the map, such as the initial center and zoom level.

It also adds the power plant data to the map as circles, with different colors representing different types of energy sources.
